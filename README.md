# Oavct# OAVCT
##  **Project Final**

Our application is an application for optimizing the management of the OAVCT system, This application finds its relevance to the fact that it is easy to deploy and above all that it processes data centrally and accessible by any Android phone connected to the network and having the required access rights. This application has a very large number of features and allows multi-site and multi-user management of the various modules developed.

##  **backend**

Nowadays, several technologies, with their associated tools, offer the Backend service for application development. These tools are well intended to carry out the coding stage. Indeed, the methods and tools chosen to design and develop an application must be based on the environment and the field of application of the latter. As part of the development of our application we chose a Backend after several analyzes and comparisons made with other similar and competing tools.
Among the leaders in this field, we chose Firebase because of the following advantages it offers: 
* **Real-time Database Helps to Store and Synchronize Data**
* **Firebase has Become Smarter with Google Analytics**
* **Firebase Offers Facility of Crash Reporting to Fix Bugs Quickly**
* **Fast and Secured Web Hosting**
* **Firebase Allows the Content Storage with Ease**
* **Developers have the Accessibility of Machine Learning**
* **Send Notifications and Messages to Targeted Audiences**
* **Send the App Recommendation through Dynamic Links**
* **Generate More Traffic to your App with App Indexing**
* **The Facility of In-App Advertising**
##  **conclusion about the choise of the backend**
Firebase is one of the effective platforms that have made the task of the app developers simpler to much extent.

##  **Internal application architecture**
Aside  from  the  default  basic  architecture  of  Android  studio,  we  have  structured  our  source  codes  into three packages:
* A package for activities
* A package for Models
* A package for adaptors
